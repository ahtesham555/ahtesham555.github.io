One of which is a man named Jon who\n    is now employed as a taxi driver. Like every other day, he went to work,\n    only to meet up one of his friends, Roger. Strangely, Roger was completely\n    silent the whole ride, bewildering Jon, as Roger was usually quite\n    talkative. After finishing his shift and arriving home, he decides to\n    contact Roger to ask if anything was wrong, considering his strange\n    behaviour. But when he calls, no answer. He tries again, surprisingly\n    someone answers the phone, but all Jon hears is loud shrieking and\n    groaning, puzzling him unbelievably, but ultimately, he decides to ignore\n    it. Jon goes to work the next day and coincidentally meets another friend,\n    Emily. After driving her to her destination, he decides to look back at\n    his friend to say goodbye but sees a creepy face staring at him before it\n    disappears. By this point, Jon feels like he is going crazy, and he\n    determines that the only way to put his mind at ease is to figure out what\n    is prompting his friends' strange behaviour. Finally, he decides to ask\n    mutuals if they have been in contact with either of them recently, but all\n    of them respond with a resounding no. After asking all their mutuals, Jon\n    is left frustrated thinking that he worked so hard only to reach a dead\n    end. He turns to the news to distract himself from his frustration, only\n    to learn of the many people who died during the disaster, and two of them\n    being his friends: Roger and Emily. Terrified of that idea of seeing his\n    friends' ghosts, he continuously lives in fear of being haunted by them,\n    until he can finally accept their death via the help of a therapist.\n  ")])])}],!1,null,null,null);n.default=component.exports}}]);
